# SKKUMAIL-DOC: A GPT-Integrated Email Service for Dynamic Content Generation

SKKUMAIL aims to revolutionize email drafting by integrating the power of GPT for content creation. It's built with Next.js, Docker, and MongoDB, offering users a seamless, dynamic, and tailored email experience.

## Building the Documentation

To build the LaTeX documentation:

1. Navigate to the directory containing the LaTeX files.
2. Use the `Makefile` commands:
   - `make`: To build the LaTeX document into a PDF.
   - `make clean`: To clean the directory of auxiliary files but retain the PDF.
   - `make deepclean`: To clean the directory including the generated PDF.
